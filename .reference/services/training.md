# Service Directive: Training & Literacy


> **Usage Rule**: Consult this directive when generating training materials, lesson plans, or educational content. Always inherit tone/identity from `directives/company_context.md`.

## 1. Service Overview
**Training, Literacy & Upskilling** focuses on empowering client teams to use AI tools effectively. We move beyond theory to practical, hands-on application.

**Typical Deliverables**:
- Interactive Workshops (Remote or In-person)
- Strategic Guidance Sessions
- Tool Usage Training (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.)
- Agentic Workflow Demos & Tutorials
- Everyday Automation Coaching

## 2. Content Structure
Training materials should follow this structure:
1.  **The "Why"**: Business context and value proposition (e.g., "Why use AI for this task?").
2.  **The "What"**: Tool/Concept introduction.
3.  **The "How"**: Step-by-step walkthroughs (Screenshots, Live Demos).
4.  **The "Now You"**: Practical exercises for immediate application.
5.  **Cheat Sheet**: One-page summary for future reference.

## 3. Tone & Approach
- **Instructional but not Academic**: Focus on "doing", not "studying".
- **Empowering**: Make the user feel capable, not overwhelmed.
- **Clear & Visual**: Use bullet points, diagrams, and bold text.
- **Context-Aware**: Relate examples to the client's actual industry/role.

## 4. Expected Outputs
When asked to generate training assets, produce:
- **Lesson Plans**: Timing, objectives, key talking points, exercises.
- **Slide Outlines**: Slide-by-slide content with speaker notes.
- **Cheat Sheets**: Markdown or PDF-ready summaries of prompts/workflows.
- **SOP Style Guides**: How to document their own new AI processes.
- **Curriculum Drafts**: Multi-session roadmaps for team upskilling.

## 5. Integration with Workflows
- **Real Examples**: Use data from `scrape_leads` or `enrich_emails` workflows to demonstrate "live" automation power during training.
- **Auto-Gen**: Use the agent to build cheat sheets based on the specific tools the client uses.
